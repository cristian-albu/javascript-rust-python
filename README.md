# Learning computer science with TypeScript, Python, and Rust

## In this project I want to acomplish two things:

- Learn the basics of computer science and web development
- Learn `TypeScript`, `Python`, and `Rust`.

Each chapter will have the same code but in different languages. No automatic conversion is allowed. Each chapter must be completed with the proper patterns for each language. At the end of this project, some databases will be used such as `MongoDB` and `MySQL`.

Each chapter will contain a folder `typescript`, `python`, and `rust`. In the typescript folder you will run

### Typescript

To use typescript and node:

```
npm init -y
npm install -D typescript @types/node
```

Then you will create a `tsconfig.json` that will contain

```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "NodeNext",
      "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
      "target": "ES2020",
      "sourceMap": true,
      "outDir": "dist",
    },
    "include": ["src/**/*"],
  }
```

The `.ts` files will be created inside a `src` folder. The main file will be `index.ts`.

Then you will be able to run:

```
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### Rust

In order to use rust:

```
cargo init

// Or

cargo new <project_name>
```

After the project is initialized you can run:

```
rustc main.rs
./main

// Or

cargo run
```

### Python

To use python you will create a new file `main.py`.

### THEORY

Each folder will also contain a file called `THEORY.md`, where are the logic, theory, and tasks will be written.

Because I want to be a better developer, I will use WSL2 (Ubuntu-22.04) to work in. No prior experience in Linux.

After completing a chapter, a "âœ…" will be added next to it.
